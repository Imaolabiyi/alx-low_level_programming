0x1A. C - Hash tables
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Tasks
0. >>> ht = {}
mandatory
Write a function that creates a hash table.

Prototype: hash_table_t *hash_table_create(unsigned long int size);
where size is the size of the array
Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table
If something went wrong, your function should return NULL
1. djb2
mandatory
Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.

Prototype: unsigned long int hash_djb2(const unsigned char *str);
You are allowed to copy and paste the function from this page
2. key -> index
mandatory
Write a function that gives you the index of a key.

Prototype: unsigned long int key_index(const unsigned char *key, unsigned long int size);
where key is the key
and size is the size of the array of the hash table
This function should use the hash_djb2 function that you wrote earlier
Returns the index at which the key/value pair should be stored in the array of the hash table
You will have to use this hash function for all the next tasks
3. >>> ht['betty'] = 'cool'
mandatory
Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.

Prototype: int hash_table_set(hash_table_t *ht, const char *key, const char *value);
Where ht is the hash table you want to add or update the key/value to
key is the key. key can not be an empty string
and value is the value associated with the key. value must be duplicated. value can be an empty string
Returns: 1 if it succeeded, 0 otherwise
In case of collision, add the new node at the beginning of the list
4. >>> ht['betty']
mandatory
Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.

Prototype: char *hash_table_get(const hash_table_t *ht, const char *key);
where ht is the hash table you want to look into
and key is the key you are looking for
Returns the value associated with the element, or NULL if key couldn’t be found
5. >>> print(ht)
mandatory
Write a function that prints a hash table.

Prototype: void hash_table_print(const hash_table_t *ht);
where ht is the hash table
You should print the key/value in the order that they appear in the array of hash table
Order: array, list
Format: see example
If ht is NULL, don’t print anything
6. >>> del ht
mandatory
Write a function that deletes a hash table.

Prototype: void hash_table_delete(hash_table_t *ht);
where ht is the hash table
7. $ht['Betty'] = 'Cool'
#advanced
In PHP, hash tables are ordered. Wait… WAT? How is this even possible?
